TODO:

  
- Fix firmware.php (urgent)
  Line up everything from mvwrt 2015 just like we see displayed from mvwrt 2014
  Maintain mvwrt 2014 menus displayed as they are. Not to be changed

- Open website in the same language as the client browser (urgent)
  When the browser is in Portuguese the default page will be portuguese ( /?hl=pt )
  When the browser is in any other language the default page will be english ( /?hl=pt 
  
  (although this coulds use geoip and support more languages; at this point only 2 are supported
   so this is not to make use of geoip tools but to actoaccording tothe browser language settings)
   
- Dropdown menus (no rush)
  In study and to be explored. No plans at the moment to implement

- Note about the changes: 
  Should be made in a simplistic way and not to depend on any extra software or dependencies

- New language to be added ?  (not a priority)
  Possibility of adding Spanish to the main page has been considered which must take into 
  account ( /?hl=es )

- XAMP server to be under chat menu (less priority than spanish language feature)
